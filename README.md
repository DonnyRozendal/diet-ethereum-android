# diet-ethereum-android
This is an Android application used for keeping track of your weight loss. It stores its data on the ethereum blockchain (Rinkeby testnet). The contract is deployed using Metamask and Remix IDE. The Java wrapper code is generated by Web3j.
## Features
- Create a wallet locally on your phone.
- User registration.
- Home screen with:
    - Wallet balance.
    - Current weight.
    - Weight progress indicator.
    - Add new weight entries.
    - See past weight entries in a bar chart.
    - Reward the user with 0.1 Ether when their milestone has been reached.
## Setup & Usage
- Clone the project
- After creating your wallet, add some test Ether to your wallet by using the Rinkeby Faucet: https://faucet.rinkeby.io/ You can find you wallet address by searching the logcat in Android Studio. Look for "wallet address".
- Create a user.
- Add weight entries.
- Receive your award when you reached your milestone.
## Contract deployment
You can already use this app without deploying a new contract. However, you can deploy a new one.
- Deploy your contract from the Remix IDE with Metamask.
- Copy the new contract address to the `EthereumRepository` file.
- Generate the new wrapper code (if you changed anything to the contract) with the following commands:
```
solc Diet.sol --bin --abi --optimize -o .
web3j generate solidity -b Diet.bin -a Diet.abi -o diet-ethereum-android/app/src/main/java -p nl.labela.dietethereumandroid.solidity
```
